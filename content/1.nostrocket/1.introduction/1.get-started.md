# New territories of freedom
Nostrocket uses Bitcoin and THE NOSTR to coordinate leaderless and location-independent Bitcoin-based economies that sustainably reward productive solutions to shared problems facing humanity.


This economic tool allows contributors to stop fiat mining and follow their passion in a way that directly contributes to an improvement in the human condition for themselves and all of humanity by solving problems in the critical path towards a Bitcoin standard with nostr as humanityâ€™s social graph.


[OXYGEN](https://nostrocket.org) is currently the most safe and effective way to use Nostrocket.

You can also watch progress on [GitHub](https://github.com/nostrocket) for now until Nostrocket itself makes the entire concept of GitHub obsolete.
