# Investors
Nostrocket is the best way to invest in projects building on Bitcoin, Lightning, and Nostr. But that's just the icing on the cake.
- Subrockets are hyper-efficient with capital and do not require a middle man between your investment and the developers writing code.
- Every Subrocket is solving a **real** and **valuable** problem that people will pay to use.
- Funds are only ever spent on **real** problems that are in the **critical path** to generating revenue.
- Nostrocket is a **noncustodial** system - revenue generated by Subrockets go directly to the shareholders. Subrockets do not require an intermediary step of miscalculating profit and loss.
- Your investment does not go into a bucket that is then used to pay for work. Instead, your investment is paying for work that is **already** done, and you can see **exactly** what that work is.
