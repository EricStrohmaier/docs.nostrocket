# Developers
Nostrocket means you get paid to work on awesome projects solving real problems for real people.
- You can work on Subrockets no matter how much or how little experience you have. 
- Nostrocket helps you become more competent by providing you with an opportunity to make meaningful and valuable contributions at your own [zone of proximal development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zone_of_proximal_development) and learn from others who know something you don't.
- There's no task delegation. You only work on the problems you enjoy. 
- You decide how much every pull request is worth based on how much time you spent on it and your level of competence. If you're not dishonest, you get to keep working on Subrockets.
- You can choose to be paid immediately in sats, or you can take shares in the project's future revenue.
